	<p>Edward Snowden is a former technical contractor for the NSA who worked for a company by the name of Booz Allen and Hamilton. While he had always been aware that the NSA was involved in questionable methods of gathering information, it was only as he became a more trusted employee that he became aware of just how questionable and widespread the NSA's information gathering program had become. Unwilling to allow such a program to continue without the public's knowledge, Snowden released documents detailing the extent of the program to the press, specifically to the The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald. He is now on the run from the U.S. Government and is currently stuck in Moscow Airport, attempting to gain political asylum from any of a variety of countries.<sup><b>1,2</b></sup></p>
